# Cucumber Redux

This library implements a [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) reducer that
builds an [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) state tree
using [Event Protocol](../event-protocol) events as
[Redux actions](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Actions.html)

The state tree is suitable for rendering Gherkin documents with results,
for example using React.
